# EasyOCR Integration - Implementation Summary

## âœ… **Successfully Added EasyOCR Selection to UI**

### **Document Processing Page**
- Added OCR Engine dropdown with options: `tesseract`, `easyocr`, `both`
- Added GPU option checkbox for EasyOCR (when selected)
- User selections are stored in session state and passed to document processor
- OCR settings temporarily override global settings during processing

### **Batch Analysis Page** 
- Added identical OCR Engine selection interface
- OCR settings applied to all files in batch processing
- Results include OCR engine metadata for each processed file

### **User Experience**
**In Document Processing:**
1. Upload documents (images, PDFs)
2. Select OCR Engine: Tesseract (fast), EasyOCR (accurate), or Both (compare)
3. Optionally enable GPU for EasyOCR
4. Process document - OCR engine used as selected

**In Batch Analysis:**
1. Upload multiple documents
2. Select processing model and OCR engine
3. Process all files with selected OCR engine
4. View results with OCR engine information

### **How OCR Engine Selection Works**
1. **Tesseract**: Traditional OCR, fast, good for clean text
2. **EasyOCR**: AI-powered OCR, better for complex layouts, handwriting, curved text
3. **Both**: Runs both engines and compares results, uses the better one

### **Benefits for French Documents**
- EasyOCR's deep learning approach handles French accented characters better
- Better recognition of complex layouts and varied fonts
- Automatic fallback if one engine fails
- Comparison mode shows which engine performs better

### **Technical Implementation**
- OCR settings temporarily override global config during processing
- Results include metadata about which engine was used
- Settings are restored after processing to avoid global state changes
- Both individual and batch processing support OCR selection

## **Files Modified**
1. `/src/dashboard/pages/document_processing.py` - Added OCR selection UI and processing logic
2. `/src/dashboard/pages/batch_analysis.py` - Added OCR selection for batch processing
3. `/src/utils/document_processor.py` - Enhanced with EasyOCR support and engine selection
4. `/src/core/config.py` - Added OCR engine configuration options
5. `/requirements.txt` - Added EasyOCR and OpenCV dependencies

## **Next Steps**
1. Install dependencies: `pip install easyocr opencv-python`
2. Test with French documents to compare OCR quality
3. Optionally install CUDA for GPU acceleration with EasyOCR
4. Use "both" mode to compare results and see which engine works better for your documents

The EasyOCR integration is now complete and ready to use! Users can select their preferred OCR engine directly in the document processing interface.
