  Ground Truth Dataset → Multi-Model Testing → Performance Comparison

  🏆 GPT-4o as Ground Truth Generator

  The system uses GPT-4o as the "gold standard" to create ground truth labels:

  # From dataset_creation_phase0.py
  def auto_label_document(doc_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
      """Auto-label document using GPT-4o as ground truth"""
      result = llm_service.extract_pii_from_image(
          document['content'],
          'openai/gpt-4o',  # Ground truth generator
          document_type=document['metadata']['document_type']
      )

      return {
          'method': 'gpt4o_vision',
          'entities': result.get('pii_entities', []),
          'confidence_score': calculate_confidence_score(result.get('pii_entities', [])),
          'processing_time': result.get('processing_time', 0)
      }

  📊 Current Implementation: Simulation + Real Framework

  1. Simulation Mode (Development)
  # Realistic but simulated metrics for testing
  base_performance = {
      "gpt-4o": {"precision": 0.92, "recall": 0.89, "f1": 0.905},
      "gpt-4o-mini": {"precision": 0.88, "recall": 0.85, "f1": 0.865},
      "claude-3-haiku": {"precision": 0.82, "recall": 0.80, "f1": 0.81}
  }

  2. Real Evaluation Framework (Production Ready)
  # From evaluation.py - Real validation against ground truth
  def evaluate_extraction_result(self,
                               predicted_result: PIIExtractionResult,
                               ground_truth: List[GroundTruthEntity]) -> EvaluationMetrics:
      # Calculate actual precision, recall, F1
      # Entity matching with position tolerance
      # Confidence distribution analysis

  🎯 How Performance Is Actually Computed

  Step 1: Generate Ground Truth
  - Upload diverse documents (PDFs, images, forms)
  - GPT-4o processes each document to extract PII
  - Human validation/correction of GPT-4o results (optional)
  - Store as ground truth dataset

  Step 2: Multi-Model Testing
  # Test multiple models against the same ground truth
  models = ["gpt-4o-mini", "claude-3-haiku", "claude-3-sonnet", "gemini-1.5-flash"]

  for model in models:
      for document in ground_truth_dataset:
          predicted_pii = model.extract_pii(document)
          actual_pii = document.ground_truth_labels

          metrics = calculate_metrics(predicted_pii, actual_pii)
          # precision, recall, F1, processing time

  Step 3: Performance Comparison
  - Compare each model's results against GPT-4o ground truth
  - Calculate variance across models (target: <10%)
  - Compare against traditional methods (OCR + spaCy, rule-based)

  🤔 Why This Approach Works

  1. GPT-4o Quality Assumption
  - GPT-4o is treated as "highly accurate enough" to serve as ground truth
  - Any validation errors are primarily due to other models, not ground truth quality

  2. Relative Performance Measurement
  - Focus is on relative performance between models
  - Less critical if ground truth has minor errors, as long as it's consistent

  3. Human-in-the-Loop Validation
  # Optional human validation of GPT-4o labels
  def validate_document_labels(document, validation_method="confidence_based"):
      # Confidence-based validation
      # Consistency pattern validation  
      # Human review for low-confidence entities

  📈 Data Flow Example

  Phase 0: Building Ground Truth
  1. Upload 50 diverse documents
  2. GPT-4o labels all PII in each document
  3. Human validates 10% of labels (quality control)
  4. Store as ground truth dataset: documents + verified PII labels

  Phase 1: Validation
  1. Test GPT-4o-mini on same 50 documents
  2. Compare its PII extraction vs ground truth labels
  3. Calculate: Precision 88%, Recall 85%, F1 86.5%
  4. Repeat for Claude, Gemini, etc.
  5. Analyze variance: Is it <10% across models?

  🎯 Key Insight

  The system doesn't need pre-existing human-labeled data because:
  - GPT-4o serves as both a production model AND a ground truth generator
  - The goal is comparative performance (Model A vs Model B vs Model C)
  - Human labeling is used for quality control, not primary ground truth creation

  This approach allows rapid validation across multiple models without expensive human annotation of large datasets, while still maintaining quality through selective human validation and
  confidence scoring.
