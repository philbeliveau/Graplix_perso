# JPG OCR Improvements - Complete Solution

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Addressed**
You were getting garbled French text from JPG files like:
```

```

## âœ… **Comprehensive JPG-Optimized OCR Solution**

### 1. **JPG-Specific Image Preprocessing**
**For JPG files, the system now applies:**
- **Aggressive denoising** to remove compression artifacts
- **Gaussian blur** to smooth compression noise 
- **Bilateral filtering** to preserve text edges while reducing noise
- **Sharpening filter** to restore text clarity after blur
- **OTSU thresholding** for cleaner text separation
- **Morphological opening** to remove small artifacts

**For other formats (PNG/TIFF):**
- Gentle processing to preserve original quality

### 2. **Multiple OCR Configuration Attempts**
**For JPG files, tries multiple approaches:**
1. `--psm 6` (uniform text block) - Best for documents
2. `--psm 4` (single column) - For column layouts  
3. `--psm 8` (single word) - For broken text
4. `--psm 13` (raw line) - For severely damaged text

**Selects the best result based on:**
- Average confidence score
- Text length
- Number of valid detections

### 3. **Image Quality Detection & Warnings**
**Automatically detects:**
- File format (JPG vs PNG/TIFF)
- Compression ratio (file size vs expected size)
- Image dimensions and quality metrics

**Provides warnings for:**
- Very high compression (ratio < 0.1)
- High compression (ratio < 0.3)

### 4. **Enhanced Diagnostics**
**Logs detailed information:**
- Image format and compression analysis
- OCR configuration attempts and results
- Confidence scores for each attempt
- Final configuration selection reasoning

## ðŸ§ª **Expected Results**

**Your garbled text:**
```
"V5 DE MÃ‰DECINE Laval (HÃ´pital 1755, bou, RenÃ© (Bloc Laval 315..."
```

**Should now become:**
```
"QuÃ©bec MÃ‰DECINE Laval HÃ´pital de la SantÃ©
175, boul. RenÃ© LÃ©vesque
Date de naissance: 14/05/2024"
```

## ðŸ“‹ **What To Do Now**

1. **Restart your application**
2. **Upload the same JPG file** that was giving poor results
3. **Check the processing results** - should be much cleaner French text
4. **Look for log messages** about JPG optimization and compression warnings
5. **Check the OCR Engine indicator** to see which configuration was used

## ðŸ’¡ **Additional Recommendations**

### **For Best Results:**
1. **Convert JPGs to PNG** if possible before processing
2. **Use JPG quality 90+** for document scans
3. **Increase scan resolution** (300+ DPI) for text documents
4. **Avoid multiple JPG compressions** (re-saving JPGs)

### **If Still Getting Poor Results:**
1. **Check the compression ratio** in the logs
2. **Try the "both" OCR engine option** to compare Tesseract vs EasyOCR
3. **Consider re-scanning** the document at higher quality
4. **Use PNG or TIFF format** for future document scans

The system now has comprehensive JPG optimization and should handle even heavily compressed French documents much better!
