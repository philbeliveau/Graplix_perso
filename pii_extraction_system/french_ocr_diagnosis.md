# French OCR Issue - Diagnosis and Solution

## üîç **Problem Identified**

Your French documents were producing garbled text like:
```
"Se de naissance esses jo ates Adiesses Adiesses Bates prio sion il nai Testes RX dro, do pout raisod merci tiom dem√©dedin : on retin: Ri TERE GHADI RG"
```

## üö® **Root Causes Found**

1. **EasyOCR Not Working**: Due to missing `libgfortran.5.dylib` library, EasyOCR was failing to initialize
2. **Suboptimal Tesseract Configuration**: Tesseract was using basic settings instead of French-optimized configuration
3. **Poor Image Preprocessing**: The image enhancement wasn't optimized for French text recognition

## ‚úÖ **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. **Improved Tesseract Configuration**
- **Language**: Changed from `eng+fra` to `fra` (French-only for better accuracy)
- **OCR Engine Mode**: Using `--oem 3` (LSTM + Legacy engine)
- **Page Segmentation**: Using `--psm 6` (uniform block of text)
- **Text Preservation**: Added `preserve_interword_spaces=1` for better word separation

### 2. **Enhanced Image Preprocessing**
- **Denoising**: Using `fastNlMeansDenoising` to clean the image
- **OTSU Thresholding**: Automatic threshold detection for better text extraction
- **Morphological Operations**: Slight text cleanup without losing character details

### 3. **Added OCR Engine Debugging**
- **UI Display**: Shows which OCR engine was actually used
- **Alternative Results**: When using "both" engines, shows comparison
- **Bounding Box Count**: Shows how many text regions were detected

## üß™ **Test Results**

With the optimized settings, a test French document showed excellent results:
```
Original: "Qu√©bec M√âDECINE Laval H√¥pital 175, bld. Ren√© L√©vesque"
OCR Result: "Qu√©bec M√âDECINE Laval H√¥pital 175, bld. Ren√© L√©vesque"
```

## üìã **What To Do Now**

### **Immediate Testing**
1. **Start the application**: `streamlit run src/dashboard/main.py`
2. **Upload your French document** in Document Processing
3. **Check the OCR Engine indicator** in the results
4. **Compare the text quality** - it should be much better now

### **If EasyOCR Becomes Available Later**
To fix the EasyOCR library issue on macOS:
```bash
# Option 1: Use conda to install scipy with proper libraries
conda install scipy

# Option 2: Install gfortran manually
brew install gcc

# Option 3: Use a fresh virtual environment
conda create -n ocr_env python=3.10
conda activate ocr_env
conda install scipy easyocr
```

### **OCR Engine Selection**
- **"tesseract"**: Now optimized for French - should work well
- **"easyocr"**: Will be available once library issue is resolved
- **"both"**: Will compare results when EasyOCR is working

## üéØ **Expected Improvement**

You should now see **dramatically better French OCR results** such as:
- Proper accent recognition: `√©`, `√®`, `√†`, `√ß`
- Better word separation and spacing
- Accurate recognition of French medical/administrative terms
- Proper handling of dates, addresses, and names

## üìä **Monitoring OCR Quality**

The UI now shows:
- **OCR Engine Used**: Confirms which engine processed your document
- **Text Regions Detected**: Number of bounding boxes found
- **Alternative Results**: Comparison when multiple engines are used

If you're still getting poor results, the issue is likely:
1. **Image quality** - try higher resolution scans
2. **Document condition** - handwriting or poor print quality
3. **File format** - some PDFs need different processing

The French OCR should now work much better with these optimizations!
