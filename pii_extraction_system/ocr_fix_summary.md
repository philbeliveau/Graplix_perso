# OCR Text Extraction Issue - FIXED

## üö® **Problem**
After optimizing OCR for French documents, you were getting minimal text output like `"ee ="` instead of proper text extraction.

## üîç **Root Cause Found**
The image preprocessing was **too aggressive** and was corrupting the text:

**Before Fix:**
- Original text: `"Test Preprocessing"`  
- After preprocessing: `"Tes: Preprocessing"` ‚ùå

The OTSU thresholding and morphological operations were damaging character shapes, causing OCR to fail.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Gentler Image Preprocessing**
**Changed from:**
- Aggressive OTSU thresholding (`cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU`)
- Large morphological kernel (2x2 rectangle)

**Changed to:**
- Gentle adaptive thresholding (`cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C`)
- Minimal morphological operation (1x1 kernel)
- Reduced denoising intensity (`h=10`)

### 2. **Improved OCR Configuration**
**Changed from:**
- `--oem 3 --psm 6 -c preserve_interword_spaces=1` (rigid)

**Changed to:**
- `--oem 3 --psm 4` (more flexible for various layouts)

## üß™ **Test Results**
**After Fix:**
- Original text: `"Test Preprocessing"`
- After preprocessing: `"Test Preprocessing"` ‚úÖ

The text is now preserved correctly through the preprocessing pipeline.

## üìã **What To Expect Now**
1. **Text extraction should work properly** - no more `"ee ="` results
2. **French characters preserved** - accents and special characters maintained
3. **Better layout handling** - PSM 4 adapts to different document structures
4. **Less noise artifacts** - gentler preprocessing reduces false characters

## üéØ **Next Steps**
1. **Restart your application**
2. **Test with the same French document** that was giving you problems
3. **The Document Text box should now show proper French text** instead of gibberish
4. **Check the OCR Engine indicator** to confirm which engine was used

The OCR system should now work much better for French documents while maintaining text integrity!
